## Overview

This package contains methods and utilities for performing gene expression deconvolution, i.e. estimating cell type proportions and/or cell-specific gene expression signatures from global expression data in heterogeneous samples.
Its main objectives are to provide:

* a unified base framework for applying and developing deconvolution analysis;
* a user-friendly and intuitive interface;
* a resource of relevant auxiliary data such as benchmark datasets or cell marker gene lists.

## Installation
